|--------|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|--------------|------|-------|
| 40w +10/-10 | 40 | +10.0% | -10.0% | 15.02% | 14.96% | 64.6% | 16.34% | Good alternative |

## üèÜ Selected Configuration: Window 50, Upper +10%, Lower -12%

### Performance Metrics:
- **Overall SELL Ratio**: 13.29% (1,560/11,737 samples)
- **Monthly Consistency**: 63.1% (41/65 months with SELL signals)
- **Average Monthly SELL**: 13.20%
- **Monthly Standard Deviation**: 16.59%

### Rationale for Selection:

1. **Risk Management Excellence**:
   - Lower threshold of -12% provides adequate downside protection
   - Balances between being too conservative (-15%) and too aggressive (-8%)
   - Captures significant market downturns while avoiding noise

2. **Optimal Signal Frequency**:
   - 13.29% SELL ratio provides sufficient positive samples for training
   - Not too sparse (like 4.81% baseline) or too frequent (like 30%+)
   - Maintains class balance for effective model learning

3. **Temporal Consistency**:
   - 63.1% monthly consistency ensures signals appear regularly
   - Avoids long periods without SELL signals (problematic for model training)
   - Provides consistent learning opportunities across different market conditions

4. **Window Size Optimization**:
   - 50-period window (200 hours) captures medium-term trends
   - Not too short (misses significant moves) or too long (delayed signals)
   - Balances responsiveness with reliability

5. **Practical Implementation**:
   - Reasonable signal frequency for real-world trading
   - Manageable false positive rate
   - Suitable for both manual and automated trading systems

| 60w +8/-12 | 15.37 | 64.6 | 17.65 | Good | Slightly high frequency |
| 30w +10/-15 | 4.81 | 35.4 | 9.67 | Very Conservative | Too sparse |

## üéØ Expected Model Performance Benefits

1. **Improved Training Stability**:
   - Sufficient positive samples (1,560 SELL signals)
   - Balanced class distribution (13.29% vs 86.71%)
   - Regular signal appearance across time periods

2. **Better Risk-Reward Profile**:
   - Captures significant downturns (-12% threshold)
   - Avoids excessive false positives
   - Maintains trading frequency suitable for implementation

3. **Enhanced Temporal Robustness**:
   - 63.1% monthly consistency ensures model sees SELL patterns regularly
   - Reduces overfitting to specific time periods
   - Improves generalization across market cycles
